# EAMRP

Designed and developed an energy-efficient multicast routing mechanism in Mobile Ad hoc Networks to optimize network connectivity and minimize faults at the link or node level. 
Implemented it using an energy-efficient neighbor node selection mechanism within the NS2 simulation framework to enhance routing efficiency. 
Conducted comparative analysis between the designed EAMRP and existing protocols, namely AODV and AOMDV. 
Evaluated the performance of the protocols based on metrics such as End-to-End delay and Packet delivery ratio, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
